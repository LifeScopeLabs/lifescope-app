                <h3>How do I sign up or log in?</h3>
                <p>LifeScope demonstrates the power and flexibility of the <a href="https://bitscoop.com" target="_blank">BitScoop platform</a> by allowing you to sign up or log in using any of the services from which you can retrieve data.</p>
                <p>Just click on any service, Connect to it, and authorize LifeScope to access the data it requests.</p>
                <p>This Connection is used for both logging you in and retrieving data, hence why it may ask for permissions that don't seem relevant for just login.</p>

                <h3>Why do I need to re-authorize permissions when logging in?</h3>
                <p>If you're logged out, we make a new Connection to that service since we don't know whether one already exists.</p>
                <p>The new Connection is automatically deleted once we can determine that you already had a Connection.</p>
                <p>Any permissions you may or may not grant on that discarded Connection are not carried over to the existing one.</p>

                <h3>Why don't all my Connections appear in the same account?</h3>
                <p>In order to associate multiple Connections with the same LifeScope account, you must be logged in and then Connect from the /providers page.</p>
                <p>If you sign up using one service, log out, then sign up using a different service, we will have ended up creating two separate LifeScope accounts for you.</p>

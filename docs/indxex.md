# Welcome to LifeScope!

We made LifeScope to help people more fully understand their lives.
LifeScope allows you to connect data from many disparate sources and services to give you a single, searchable repository of what you've done.

Can't remember whether you sent a message to someone via Facebook, Twitter, email, or text message, and only have a general idea of when you sent it?
Search LifeScope for interactions with that person in a two-week range.

Want to see all of your events from a trip you took?
Draw a geofence around that area.

Just want an easy way to look back on what you've posted on Instagram?
LifeScope makes that simple too.

We want to empower you, the average person, to know more about yourself by breaking down the walls around your data, and we want to do it as transparently as possible.
Our product's code is [open-source](https://github.com/LifeScopeLabs), meaning anyone can build and run their own copy and never have their data touch anyone else's servers.
All of the features we're planning on adding are designed around letting you better interact with your data and share it only with those whom you want to see it.
We give you control over what data you want us to retrieve, and deleting your account will remove all of the data we've collected for you; it's like you never even used LifeScope in the first place.

We're always happy to receive feedback and suggestions; email us at [support@lifescope.io](support@lifescop.io).

## In a nutshell, how does this all work?

LifeScope works primarily off of Connections we make on your behalf to third-party services you use such as Facebook, GitHub, and Spotify.
We use the credentials that you authorize to retrieve the data that you give us access to, format it to [our schema](/learn/schema), and store it in a database.
We continue to fetch new data via that Connection on a regular basis, generally once a day.
Once the data is in our system, you can search it via keywords, [tags](/learn/tags), and [several types of filters](/learn/filters).

We're also building out additional features to let you explore, experience, and share your data in exciting and innovative ways, such as a multi-user VR showroom.
